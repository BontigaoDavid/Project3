            ECMAScript 2015 is the 6th version of the ECMAScript programming
            languange, hence the name ES6. It has been around for a couple of
            years now and is used by most developers. We cover this subject
            material because we want aspiring developers to be more comfortable
            with using ES6 to be employer competitive, modernize their code, and
            make it more readable. With the ES6 features, we are able to write
            less and do more with our code.
